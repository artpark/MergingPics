# MergingPics
Takes two images and merges them using transparency, all while keeping the original dimensions.

## To run:
Download [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) and open TransparentImages.pde. The directory that contains the .pde file must have files "1.png" and "2.png" to combine.

## Credits and sources:
[Tom Wildenhain](https://github.com/TomWildenhain/MagicPNG) created the original code in C++. This recreation utilizes Processing 3.
